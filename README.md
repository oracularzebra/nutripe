# This is a nutritional-recipe webapp
Using this we can know how much nutritions we are intaking by consuming the food.
Made using javascript framework ReactJs. The webapp currently uses two api's one 
for fetching the recipe which includes recipe title, ingredients required, serving 
size and instructions, the other api is used to fetch the pictures related to the 
food item. Both the api's are from rapidApi. The app is currently is pre-alpha phase, 
there's no home page(because I don't have any idea of what to display there) but there
will be one soon.
